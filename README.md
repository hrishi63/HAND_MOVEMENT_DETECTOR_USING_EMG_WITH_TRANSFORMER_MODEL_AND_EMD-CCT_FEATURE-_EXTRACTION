# ü¶æ EMG-Based Hand Movement Detector  
### Using EMD-CCT Feature Extraction and Transformer Model

This repository implements an **EMG-based hand movement detection system** using **Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD)** and **Cross-Correlation Tensor (CCT)** for feature extraction, combined with a **Transformer-based model** for classification.

## üöÄ Project Overview

Electromyography (EMG) signals are generated by muscle activity and can be used to recognize hand gestures.  
In this project, we aim to detect and classify hand movements using:
- **EMD** to extract signal components
- **CCT** to capture relationships between EMG channels
- **Transformer encoder** for robust temporal pattern learning

## üß† Methodology

1. **Signal Preprocessing**
   - Band-pass filtering and normalization of EMG data

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - EMD ‚Üí empirical mode decomposition 
   - CCT ‚Üí correlation coefficient threshold

3. **Model Architecture**
   - Transformer encoder with multi-head attention
   - Fully connected classifier for movement prediction
